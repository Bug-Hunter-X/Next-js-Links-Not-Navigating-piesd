# Next.js Links Not Navigating

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js applications where links, despite rendering correctly, fail to navigate to their intended destinations.

The problem is often subtle, stemming from incorrect usage of the `next/link` component or other related configurations. The example provided showcases a basic setup with the issue, followed by a solution to ensure correct navigation.

## Reproduction Steps:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Observe that the links do not function as expected.

## Solution:
The solution involves ensuring that the links are correctly constructed within the `next/link` component, and potentially checking the routing configurations within `pages/_app.js` or `next.config.js` if more complex scenarios are involved. Check the `bugSolution.js` file for a corrected example.
